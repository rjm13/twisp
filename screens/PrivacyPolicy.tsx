Privacy Policy
About this Policy
This Policy describes how we process your personal data at MartianSpiderMedia.

​

It applies to your use of:

all Twisp streaming services as a user. This includes use of these services under our free or paid options (each a "Service Option"); and

other Twisp services which include a link to this Privacy Policy (e.g. Twisp websites).

From now on, we'll collectively call these the "Twisp Service".

​

From time to time, we may develop new or offer additional services. They'll also be subject to this Policy unless stated otherwise when we introduce them.

​

This Policy is not...

                Personal Data We Collect
            </Text>
            <Text style={{fontSize: 14, color: '#fff', margin: 20}}>
            We collect personal data to create your Twisp account and enable you to use the Twisp Service.


The type of data collected depends on the type of Service Option you have, how you create your account, the country you are in, and if you use third party services to sign in. This may include your:

profile name

email address

phone number

date of birth

gender

street address

country

​

We receive some of this data from you e.g. from the sign up form or account page.


We also collect some of this data from your device e.g. country. We may ask for your street address for the following reasons:

to check eligibility for a Service Option

for tax administration

to deliver physical goods or gifts requested by you


In some cases, we may use a third party mapping application (such as Google Maps) to help you verify your address.


Other data we collect relates to information about how you use Blip.
Examples include:

Information about your Twisp Service Option.

Your actions with the Twisp Service (including date and time), such as:

search queries

listening history

playlists you create

your library

browsing history

account settings

interactions with other Twisp users

your use of third party services, devices and applications in connection with the Twisp Service

Inferences (i.e., our understanding) of your interests and preferences based on your usage of the Twisp Service.

Content you post to any part of the Twisp Service, such as images, text, communications, and other types of content.


Other technical data we collect includes, but is not limited to:

URL information

Online identifiers such as cookies and IP addresses

Information about the devices you use such as:

device IDs

network connection type (e.g. wifi, 4G, LTE, Bluetooth)

provider

network and device performance

browser type

language

information enabling digital rights management

operating system

Twisp application version

Information (such as the device name, device identifiers, brand and version) which enables us to discover and connect with third party devices and applications such as those listed below:

devices on your wifi network (such as speakers) which can connect to the Twisp Service

devices made available by your operating system when connecting via Bluetooth, plugin, and installation

Blip partner applications to determine whether the application is installed on your device


We may collect your general (non-precise) location. This may be understood from technical data (e.g. your IP address, language setting of your device, or payment currency). We need this to meet geographic requirements in our agreements with the owners of content on the Twisp Service, and to deliver content and advertising that’s relevant to you.

​

Additional data you may choose to give us includes:

 

Voice Data
If voice features are available in your market and only where you’ve given permission, we collect voice data (audio clips of your voice). This makes it possible for us to provide and improve Twisp's voice features.

​

If you make any purchases from Twisp (including a paid Service Option) or sign up for a trial, we will need to process your payment data. The exact personal data collected will vary depending on the payment method, but will include information such as:

name

date of birth

credit or debit card type, expiration date, and certain digits of your card number (Note: For security, we never store your full card number)

ZIP/postal code

mobile phone number

details of your purchase and payment history

​

When you complete any forms, respond to a survey or questionnaire, or take part in a contest or sweepstake, we collect the personal data you provide.

​

If you register for or log into our services using another service, we’ll receive your information from them to help create your account with us.

 

If you connect your Twisp account to a third party application, service and/or devices, we may collect certain information from them to make the integration possible.


These third party apps, services or devices may include:

social media

devices including:

audio (e.g. speakers and headphones)

smart watches

televisions

mobile phones and tablets

automotive (e.g. cars)

games consoles

services or platforms such as voice assistants

​

We’ll ask your permission before we collect your information from certain third parties.

​

We may work with technical service partners that give us certain data, such as mapping IP addresses to non-precise location data (e.g., city, state). This makes it possible for Twisp to provide the Twisp Service, content, and features.

​

If you choose to pay Twisp by invoice, we may get data from our payment partners.
This allows us to:

send you invoices

process your payment

give you what you’ve purchased

​

We may get data about you from certain advertising or marketing partners.


This may include:

cookie id

mobile device id

email address

inferences (i.e., our understanding) of your interests and preferences

​

This allows us to deliver more relevant ads and marketing.

The following personal data will always be publicly available on the Twisp Service:

Your profile name

Your profile photo

Your public bios (including publisher, narrator, and illustrator bios)

​

We will only share the following personal data:

where sharing of particular personal data is needed for the use of a Twisp Service feature, or a third party application, service or device, which you have chosen to use; or

if you otherwise grant us your permission to share the personal data, e.g. by selecting the appropriate setting in the Twisp Service or by giving your consent

​

We may share your data to connect your Twisp account, and/or allow you to use the Twisp Service in connection with third party applications, services or devices. Examples of such third party applications, services and devices include: social media applications, speaker devices, televisions, automotive platforms, or voice assistants, which interact with the Twisp Service.

​

We may share your data to receive news or promotional offers directly from other partners.
You may choose to share personal data (for example, your email address) for this purpose. You’ll always have the option to change your mind and withdraw your consent at any time.


We may share your information with other parties. These service providers may include those we hire to:

give customer support

operate the technical infrastructure we need to provide the Twisp Service

assist in protecting and securing our systems and services (e.g. Google’s reCAPTCHA)

help market Twisp's (and our partners’) services, events and promotions

​

We may share your information with payment processors so they can process your payments, and for anti-fraud purposes.

​

We may share your information with advertising partners so our ad partners can help us deliver more relevant advertising to you on the Twisp Service.


For example, our ad partners help us facilitate tailored advertising:

This is when we use third party information to tailor ads to be more relevant to you (also known as interest based advertising).

An example of a tailored ad is when an ad partner has information suggesting you like cars, which could enable us to show you ads about cars.

 

We share some personal data with these partners where necessary to:

enable you to participate in Blip promotions, including trials or other bundled offers

to promote Blip in media and advertising published on other online services

help us and our partners to measure the effectiveness of Twisp promotions


Examples of partners include:

marketing or sponsorship partners

websites and mobile apps who sell us advertising space on their services

device, app and mobile partners who also offer Twisp promotions


Our partners may also combine the personal data we share with them with other data they collect about you (e.g. your use of their services). We and our partners may use this information to present you with offers, promotions, or other marketing activities that we believe will be relevant to you.

 

We may share personal data with partners to help us understand and improve the performance of our products and partnerships.

​

We may share your information with academic researchers for activities such as statistical analysis and academic study, but only in a pseudonymised format. Pseudonymised data is where your data is identified by a code rather than your name or other information that directly identifies you.

​

We may share your information with law enforcement and other authorities when we believe in good faith it’s necessary for us to do so, for example:

to comply with a legal obligation

to respond to a valid legal process (such as a search warrant, court order, or subpoena)

if there's an unresolved issue relating to your account, such as an outstanding credit or unresolved claim or dispute

Keeping Your Personal Data Safe
We're committed to protecting our users' personal data. We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to help protect the security of your personal data. However, be aware that no system is ever completely secure.

​

We have implemented various safeguards including pseudonymization, encryption, access, and retention policies to guard against unauthorised access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems.

​

To protect your user account, we encourage you to:

use a strong password that is unique to your Odyssey account

never share your password with anyone

limit access to your computer and browser

log out once you have finished using the Odyssey Service on a shared device

​

If other individuals have access to your Odyssey account (for example if you've given them permission to use your account on a shared device), then they can access personal data, controls and the Odyssey Service available in your account.

​

It's your responsibility to only provide individuals with permission to use your account where you're comfortable sharing this personal data with them. Anyone else's use of your Odyssey account may impact your personalised recommendations and be included in your data download.

            <Text style={{fontSize: 14, color: '#fff', margin: 20}}>
            The Twisp Service has a minimum "Age Limit" in each country. The Twisp Service is not directed to children whose age:

is under the age of 13 years

or, makes it illegal to process their personal data

or, requires parental consent to process their personal data

​

We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the applicable Age Limit. If you're under the Age Limit, please do not use the Twisp Service, and do not provide any personal data to us.

​

If you're a parent of a child under the Age Limit and become aware that your child has provided personal data to Twisp, please contact us.

​

If we learn that we've collected the personal data of a child under the applicable Age Limit, we'll take reasonable steps to delete the personal data. This may require us to delete the Twisp account for that child.

​

When using a shared device on the main Twisp Service, you should be cautious about playing or recommending any content to individuals under 18 years old which could be inappropriate for them.
